# SFP-Access-Port
Software supporting the SFP Access Port hardware

The SFP Access Port project is an open source effort to create the hardware and associated software capable of reading and writing to the embedded EEPROM found on SFP and SFP+ tranciever modules, as well as other trancievers compliant with the relevant standards.

## Why?
All SFP modules contain an onboard EEPROM - this EEPROM contains information about the modules itself, inluding it's capabilies, compatibilies and vendor origin. The ability to extract this information from trancievers can be beneificial for a number of reason.

SFP modules are frequenetly coded with specific hardware vendors with which it should be considered compatiable - depsite the hardware being identical to other modules. Conversly, some network appliance vendors will lock their devices to only work correctly with specific modules.

This project provides the tools required to read and write this information from compliant modules under certain conditions.
